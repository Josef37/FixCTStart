# Fix Custom Training Start

Stops custom training shots from beginning when you don't want to.

To disable:\
F2 -> Plugins -> Plugin Manager -> Open pluginmanager -> untick the FixCTStart plugin

Ignore steer input (set by default):\
F6 -> Type "fix_ct_start_steer 1" -> Enter

Ignore throttle input (not set by default):\
F6 -> Type "fix_ct_start_throttle 1" -> Enter

To revert these configuration changes, do the same, but enter "0" instead of "1".
